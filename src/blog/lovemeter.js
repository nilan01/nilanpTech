                        The LOVE-O-METER was designed to measure the temperature of a person's hand. The hotter the individual, the more LEDS would light up - simple. This project was a great way for me to
                        begin understanding how a microcontroller is able use sensors to detect different types of energy in it's surroundings and transduce this energy into electrical energy (to be then read by a PC). 
                         
                    </p>
                        <p>
                        I put together the LOVE-O-METER using a TMP36 (temperature sensor) three resistors, three LEDS, and a few wires to connect these components across a breadboard, to ground, and to power.
                        </p>

                    <br></br>
                    <p>
                        Once temperature is read by the TMP36 temperature sensor, heat energy is sent to the Analog-to-Digital Converter via analog pin A0 (or a pin of your liking). These pins can report back a value between 0 - 1023, which maps to a range of 0 - 5 volts (conversion can be seen in the code below).
                        I have written, compiled, and uploaded code to my Arduino Uno to illuminate LEDS depending on how warm an individual is.

                    <p>Arduino software (IDE) has a built in serial monitor, which allows users to view information relayed from a microcontroller to his/her computer in real-time. Below you may see an example of what the serial monitor looked like as I ran the LOVE-O-METER:</p>
