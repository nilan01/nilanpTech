                    The LOVE-O-METER was designed to measure the temperature of a person's hand. The hotter the individual, the more LEDS would light up - simple.
                    I put together the LOVE-O-METER using a TMP36 (temperature sensor) three resistors, three LEDS, and a few wires to connect these components across a breadboard, to GND, and to power.
